Emacs 29 will be the next stable release later in 2023 adding major features: Eglot LSP client, Tree-Sitter language parser and `package.el` package install from Git repositories. more features to enhance and improved every day use of Emacs.

Building from source is a convenient way to try Emacs features in advance, especially useful for those maintaining or developing new tools on top of Emacs.

## Building steps for the impatient

Add Ubuntu packages for building Emacs

```shell
sudo apt build-dep emacs && \
sudo apt install libgccjit0 libgccjit-10-dev libjansson4 libjansson-dev gnutls-bin libtree-sitter-dev
```

[Clone Emacs 29 source code](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git), configure and build emacs and then install (in /usr/local/bin/)

```shell
git clone --branch emacs-29 git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git emacs-29 && cd emacs-29 && \
export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-10  && export CXX=/usr/bin/gcc-10 && ./autogen.sh && ./configure --with-native-compilation=aot && \
make -j$(proc)  && /
sudo make install
```

> skip the branch for the very latest commits to Emacs which will effectively become Emacs 30 some time in the next year or so

Read the rest of the article for a detailed description of this workflow


## Prepare Ubuntu

Open `Software & Updates` and ensure the Source Code source is enabled and reload the package list (or run `sudo apt update` in a terminal after adding Source Code)

![Ubuntu Software & Updates - Download from Source Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicalli/graphic-design/live/ubuntu/screenshots/ubuntu-sofware-updates-download-from-source-code.png)

Ask Ubuntu to install the packages required to build Emacs (there will be quite a few packages if this is the first software built with GCC on the operating system)

```shell
sudo apt build-dep -y emacs
```

> The previous approach was to use `sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc git-core`. Using build-deps manages the set of packages required as Emacs evolves.

Install some additional libraries to support the newest features of Emacs, native compilation of Emacs packages (`libgccjit`), fast JSON processing (`libjansson`) and tree-sitter support.  These really boost performance, so are important to add.

```shell
sudo apt install libgccjit0 libgccjit-10-dev libjansson4 libjansson-dev libtree-sitter-dev
```

> On Ubuntu 20.04 `sudo apt-get install gnutls-bin` removes a potential issue from an older certificates library


## Preparing Emacs source code

Use a Git client to clone the latest code from [the Emacs repository](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git), or open a terminal and use the Git command line client

```shell
git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git
```

> To build version of Emacs that is already release, **[Download source from a nearby GNU mirror](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html)**, either tar.gz or tar.xz

Change into the cloned directory

```shell
cd emacs
```

Set `CC` and `CXX` environment variables to inform the Emacs configuration script as to the location of gcc-10, otherwise it fails to find libgccjit

```shell
export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-10 && export CXX=/usr/bin/gcc-10
```

> If CC and CXX environment variables are not set, the configure script will not find important libraries and report errors such as: `configure: error: ELisp native compiler was requested, but libgccjit was not found.`


Run the autogen script to create a configure script specific to your operating system.

```shell
./autogen.sh
```

Run the configuration script with the native compilation flag, to compile Emacs native Elisp files during the Emacs compilation rather than when first running Emacs.  This script will check the operating system for tools and libraries needed to build Emacs on your operating system.

```shell
./configure --with-native-compilation=aot
```

Check the output of `./configure` was successful, see the end of this article for an example.  Ignore warnings about movemail if not using Emacs for local email management.

> `./configure --help` lists available flags. Generally features are enabled if the required libraries are installed on the operating system.
> A noticeable exception is native compilation, as its a relatively new feature and not enabled by default.


## Building Emacs locally

Build Emacs using all the CPU's of your computer.  `-j` flag specifies the number of CPU's to use, `nproc` command returns the total number of CPU's for the computer (real and virtual cores combined).

```
make -j$(nproc)
```

Run Emacs using the `-Q` option to check Emacs runs without using a users configuration file (e.g. without loading an `~/.emacs.d/ configuration)

```
./src/emacs -Q
```

`C-x C-c` to quit Emacs.

If Emacs runs then it is ready to install.


## Install Emacs system wide

Install `emacs` and `emacsclient` to `/usr/local/bin` along with supporting libraries and man pages using the Makefile

```
sudo make install
```

To install in a different location, pass the full path using the `--prefix` option to make, e.g `make install --prefix /opt/emacs`


## Running Emacs

If the default `/usr/local` path was used to install Emacs, then the `emacs` and `emacsclient` binary files are already on the executable path

In a terminal, run the emacs command

```
emacs
```

If using Emacs 28 with Spacemacs for the first time, all Spacemacs packages in your configuration will be downloaded and compiled.  This may take 5-15 minutes and Emacs may make full use of your CPU (spawning several emacs processes on multi-core computers)

Leave Emacs for a few minutes running until the CPU activity has subsided and then consider restarting Emacs to ensure the packages have been loaded in the correct order.

> Expect to see lots of warning messages when installing more than 250 emacs packages.  Ignore these warnings until all packages have been installed.  If warnings still occur after restarting Emacs, then start investigating (or ask questions on #spacemacs channel in the Clojurians Slack community)


## Removing Emacs

In the Emacs source code directory where Emacs was built, use the Makefile to remove the Emacs binaries, libraries and man pages.

```
sudo make uninstall
```


## Emacs build configure output

Typical output of  `./configure --with-native-compilation`

Almost all configuration options should be yes, although there are a few legacy libraries or settings for other OSs that should be no.

## Emacs 29 configuration options

Run configure with `--help` option to list the available compilation options.  Apart from `--with-native-compilation=aot` defaults are used when Practicalli compiles Emacs.

```shell
Optional Packages:
  --with-PACKAGE[=ARG]    use PACKAGE [ARG=yes]
  --without-PACKAGE       do not use PACKAGE (same as --with-PACKAGE=no)
  --without-all           omit almost all features and build small executable
                          with minimal dependencies
  --with-mailutils        rely on GNU Mailutils, so that the --without-pop
                          through --with-mailhost options are irrelevant; this
                          is the default if GNU Mailutils is installed
  --with-pop              Support POP mail retrieval if Emacs movemail is used
                          (not recommended, as Emacs movemail POP is
                          insecure). This is the default only on native
                          MS-Windows.
  --with-kerberos         support Kerberos-authenticated POP
  --with-kerberos5        support Kerberos version 5 authenticated POP
  --with-hesiod           support Hesiod to get the POP server host
  --with-mail-unlink      unlink, rather than empty, mail spool after reading
  --with-mailhost=HOSTNAME
                          string giving default POP mail host
  --with-sound=VALUE      compile with sound support (VALUE one of: yes, alsa,
                          oss, bsd-ossaudio, no; default yes). Only for
                          GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, MinGW, Cygwin.
  --with-pdumper=VALUE    enable pdumper support unconditionally ('yes', 'no',
                          or 'auto': default 'auto')
  --with-unexec=VALUE     enable unexec support unconditionally ('yes', 'no',
                          or 'auto': default 'auto')
  --with-dumping=VALUE    kind of dumping to use for initial Emacs build
                          (VALUE one of: pdumper, unexec, none; default
                          pdumper)
  --with-x-toolkit=KIT    use an X toolkit (KIT one of: yes or gtk, gtk2,
                          gtk3, lucid or athena, motif, no)
  --with-wide-int         prefer wide Emacs integers (typically 62-bit); on
                          32-bit hosts, this allows buffer and string size up
                          to 2GB, at the cost of 10% to 30% slowdown of Lisp
                          interpreter and larger memory footprint
  --without-xpm           don't compile with XPM image support
  --without-jpeg          don't compile with JPEG image support
  --without-tiff          don't compile with TIFF image support

  --without-rsvg          don't compile with SVG image support
  --without-webp          don't compile with WebP image support
  --without-sqlite3       don't compile with sqlite3 support

  --with-json             compile with native JSON support
  --with-tree-sitter      compile with tree-sitter
  --without-xft           don't use XFT for anti aliased fonts
  --without-harfbuzz      don't use HarfBuzz for text shaping
  --without-libotf        don't use libotf for OpenType font support
  --without-m17n-flt      don't use m17n-flt for text shaping
  --without-toolkit-scroll-bars
                          don't use Motif/Xaw3d/GTK toolkit scroll bars
  --without-xaw3d         don't use Xaw3d
  --without-xim           at runtime, default X11 XIM to off
  --without-xdbe          don't use X11 double buffering support
  --with-ns               use Nextstep (macOS Cocoa or GNUstep) windowing
                          system. On by default on macOS.
  --with-w32              use native MS Windows GUI in a Cygwin build
  --with-pgtk             use GTK to support window systems other than X
  --without-gpm           don't use -lgpm for mouse support on a GNU/Linux
                          console
  --without-dbus          don't compile with D-Bus support
  --with-gconf            compile with Gconf support (Gsettings replaces this)
  --without-gsettings     don't compile with GSettings support
  --without-selinux       don't compile with SELinux support
  --without-gnutls        don't use -lgnutls for SSL/TLS support
  --without-zlib          don't compile with zlib decompression support
  --without-modules       don't compile with dynamic modules support
  --without-threads       don't compile with elisp threading support
  --with-cygwin32-native-compilation
                          use native compilation on 32-bit Cygwin
  --without-xinput2       don't use version 2 of the X Input Extension for
                          input
  --with-small-ja-dic     generate a smaller-size Japanese dictionary
  --with-file-notification=LIB
                          use a file notification library (LIB one of: yes,
                          inotify, kqueue, gfile, w32, no)
  --with-xwidgets         enable use of xwidgets in Emacs buffers (requires
                          gtk3 or macOS Cocoa)
  --with-be-app           enable use of Haiku's Application Kit as a window
                          system
  --with-be-cairo         enable use of cairo under Haiku's Application Kit
  --without-compress-install
                          don't compress some files (.el, .info, etc.) when
                          installing. Equivalent to: make GZIP_PROG= install
  --with-gameuser=USER_OR_GROUP
                          user for shared game score files. An argument
                          prefixed by ':' specifies a group instead.
  --with-gnustep-conf=FILENAME
                          name of GNUstep configuration file to use on systems
                          where the command 'gnustep-config' does not work;
                          default $GNUSTEP_CONFIG_FILE, or
                          /etc/GNUstep/GNUstep.conf
  --with-native-compilation[=TYPE]
                          compile with Emacs Lisp native compiler support. The
                          TYPE 'yes' (or empty) means to enable it and compile
                          natively preloaded Lisp files; 'no' means to disable
                          it; 'aot' will make the build process compile all
                          the Lisp files in the tree natively ahead of time.
                          (This will usually be quite slow.)
  --with-x                use the X Window System
  --without-libgmp        do not use the GNU Multiple Precision (GMP) library;
                          this is the default on systems lacking libgmp.
  --without-included-regex
                          don't compile regex; this is the default on systems
                          with recent-enough versions of the GNU C Library
                          (use with caution on other systems).
