## Faux pairing

Dressing up of a live coding test as pairing where there is little or no intent to pair on the side of the interviewer.

Issues
* Its not pairing, so you are lying about your process
* Gives the impression the company doesnt understand or doesnt actually do pairing
* False situation that only demonstrates an ability to cope with scrutiny
* Interupts the flow of though
* Pairing requires a level of trust

## Requirements
The approach to be taken when pairing must be specified clearly.

Ideally pairing would take the canonical extreme

## Leaves a bad impression

At best, faux pairing prevents the interviewee from learning what its really like to work with the team.

At its worse, it leaves the person being interviewed with a very negative view of the team.  Paints them as unhelpful or not possibly event doubt about the interviewers skills.


## A collaborative process

Pairing should be a collaborative process.

When there is a good relationship between people, a level of safety and trust is more readily achieved.

When the focus of 'pairing' becomes an evaluation of one person, collaboration is very easy to break.   Without a relationship there is no established trust and great care is required to establish an environment where someone can make mistakes without being concerned that they are being judged.

As 'faux pairing' is an evaluation, then every mistake is easily considered a mark against the person under evaluation, especially by the person being evaluated.




## Pairing is well defined

The Ext


Wikipedia definition

Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation [REPL interface].

The driver writes code while the navigator reviews code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

While reviewing, the observer also considers the "strategic" direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. This is intended to free the driver to focus all of their attention on the "tactical" aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide.


## Actually pairing

To establish trust and safety, the interviewer must place themselves at the same level of vulnerability as the interviewee.

The driver of the code should swap at a very regular cadence (or as identified in a planning session before coding)

The benefit of this includes

* a far fairer assessment of a person being interviewed
* a better understanding of the team from the perspective of the interviewee


> Jumping straight into coding will not really show ways of working, as typing in code is only really takes up 5% of the work an engineer will do (assuming they touch type)

## Jointly choosing a challenge

## Discussing how to solve a challenge first

Before creating any code, discuss as if you are a team how to solve the problem

What is the data model (or models) required

What sort of transformations are required

Identify aspects that are considered challenging, establishing where each person feels help is required.  This can help guide who is the driver when tackling aspects of the challenge.
