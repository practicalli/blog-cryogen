**Article title**
A meaningful title for the article, summing up the focus of the article

**Article description or content**
A good article would include

* an introduction to the subject to be covered and why its valuable
* detailed description of the subject, including lots of examples (code, screenshots, videos, etc).
* a summary of the lessons learned in the article

Content should be written in markdown (although I am experimenting with asciidoc).  Images and videos should be shared as publicly accessible links
